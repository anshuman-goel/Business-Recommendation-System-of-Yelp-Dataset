1. Converting all files from json to csv for easier reading and utlizing the existing resources. [ref: https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples]

2. Loading business data. Dropping variables ['type','postal_code','latitude','longitude','review_count','attributes','address','is_open','hours','stars']

3. Filtered data to contain only state 'NC'

4. Loading review data. keeping only business id, user id, stars, funny, cool, and useful votes.

5. Merging both datasets by business id.

6. Updating value of the rating 'stars' by the formula (definiately it includes bias):
if stars>=3
        stars=stars+(0.1*funny+.6*useful+0.3*cool)/(funny+useful+cool+1)
else
        stars=stars-(0.1*funny+.6*useful+0.3*cool)/(funny+useful+cool+1)
